1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. [Stackoverflow.com for the random integer generator.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) [The biggest challenge I encountered was creating the game logic. The logic for the guess function in the "script.js" file had me there for a while. Even though I knew the answer was there for me to look at, I attempted this without looking. It isn't always the easiest thing in the world to implement some logic you can explain in english into code. Espically if it's in a coding language you're not too comfortable around using yet. Overcoming this wasn't easy either. I tried and tried but it wouldn't work in the way I wanted. The way I overcame this was by simply taking a break, sometimes people need a break from their work just to come back and see that the reason why they were stuck was because they made a simple mistake. It happens, we're all not perfect and this shows that sometimes when debugging a program, you should take a break from time to time.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) [After completing this assignment, I wonder if this is what web developers have to go through on a day to day basis. Like do web developers spend more time debugging than actually programming? When making larger projects or programs, do they ever get frustrated and want to drop the project or give up? At times like these, what really inspire web developers to do what they do on a day to day basis? Is it that they simply enjoy doing whatever that they're doing? Or is there something more to it?]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) [I would honestly just sit around and change up a lot of the features on the game. Some features like the colors on the boxes and sound pitches that they make. I would probably even spend more time making my own sounds for the game itself to make it more original. I even thought about adding a background image onto the game other than just having a black screen for people to look at. Maybe a NYC background that I took or something around there. But overall I enjoyed making this project, it was really fun getting to learn new things about web development.]
